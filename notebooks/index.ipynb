    "The MOHGP model is Hierarhical because is uses a hierachy of GPs to model first the mean of the cluster, and then the deviation of each time-course in the cluster from that mean.

The illustratory examples shows how to model a time series with diverging populations over time, and how to separate noise from signal. "
